  # About
  disable_about: false
  descripe_l1_person: "Proteins are the fundamental unit of cellular function and understanding how cells regulate the production and dynamics of these molecules promises to transform our understanding of biology. As datasets and public repositories grow, it is more important than ever to make the information available to researchers. As a data scientist and mass spectrometrist, I work to bridge the gap between raw data and biological insight through fast extensible code and automated analyses."
  descripe_l2_person: "Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the Vill√©n lab at UW Genome Sciences. Here I build tools and repositories to improve the study of protein post translational modifications. Sometimes, I put together smaller analyses of individual datasets, and I am always looking for new interesting questions. Have a look at my projects posted below, and feel free to get in contact if you would like to work together."
